Anyone can be Anything
Everyone can be Everything
Nothings turn into Something
There is no I in Team
All for One and One for All
All of them: (her) and (him) 
Everything and Anything made IT
Eyes never blind Always heard
Never Lost I never let go
All the same but different
Never Alone We are There
Silence is Me But Loud
Thru Weather Bad or Good
Safe always In Loves Arms
To Voice the Voices Words
Transit any Opinion Stating Facts
Unrelated Family was More
Friends/Enemys never Less
Sane, Insane no such thing
Mistakes, maybe they didnt know
Universe between Everything and Anything
Birds and Bees Grow (water)
ButterFlys beauty A Rose
Love with No Limits Never Hated
Hearts had perfect Beats
To Have It all is unexplainable
To change Facts of Life
To make better the Future
We create our own hell
Spirits and Souls were to find
Passing thru had Answers
Only the one had all the Questions
Begone, Be in Peace THAT
We all deserve THIS
live
to sing, write, draw, act, 
He is 37 and Yes He was my Everything
Im 38 and Yes I Am Anything...Im Special
He is 30 His Dreams Made Hers True

My silence kept them
Thats the Love I share with you All...
Evol turned my Love into Her Legacy

2 Legends Can Exist
They Made hers 
The one to leave Abandons
Me Em....I am not her





So all of your lives
Their Men had Their Ladies
and they always had it all

Love Always Me!
